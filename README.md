                                                           Karate Cats

“No one knows why this evil cat with a scar over his left eye, stole the ring of fire,”
exclaimed Robby the reporter. This evil cat is traveling to the Cat Kingdom. If you live
in the Cat Kingdom, you need to evacuate now. Meanwhile, on the edge of the Cat Kingdom,
in a little house, two brothers were munching on their breakfast. The older brother's name
was Catty, and he was twelve. The younger brother’s name was Meowmeow, and he was ten years
old. Catty and Meowmeow were happily devouring their breakfast when Tom, their dad, walked
into the room. He told them that they had to evacuate to Cat Cong. “What!” Catty and Meowmoew
replied. Then Tom told them to pack their bags because they needed to leave now.

When Meowmoew went up to his room to pack his backpack, he stared out of his widow. He noticed
a very strange cat, who had a scar over his left eye. It was the evil cat who stole the ring of
fire, Meowmeow thought. Then he screamed, grabbed his backpack, and ran out of his room. Catty
was in the hallway when Meowmeow screamed. Then Meowmeow quickly grabbed Catty and they jumped
out of a window, and fell on their Mom’s flower bed. Tom ran out of the house and asked Catty
and Meowmeow if they were ok. Suddenly, their house went up in flames! 

Startled, Tom, Catty, and Meowmeow ran into the forest, behind their house. There they met Ava,
the witch, who told them that the evil cat, who destroyed their house, was after Catty and Meowmoew.
She also told them that Catty and Meowmeow needed to learn karate, so they could defend themselves.
Thus, they set out on a journey to a new city called New Cat City, because Zebra the karate master
lives there. After a long and dangerous trip to New Cat City, Catty, Meowmeow, and Tom made it to
Zebra’s dojo, and began to learn karate. Catty and Meowmeow were very skilled at karate, and Tom
was not the best at karate. Zebra, who lives with Magic Cat, the wizard, taught them to be karate
masters.

The evil cat, who was after Catty and Meowmeow, was tracking them down. Zebra told Catty and
Meowmeow that they should stop him from entering New Cat City. Catty, Meowmeow, and Tom were
preparing to stop the evil cat at the Bridge of Destiny. While Zebra, and Magic Cat evacuated
the cats of New Cat City. When the evil cat arrived at the Bridge of Destiny, Catty and Meowmeow
were on the other side of the bridge. The evil cat’s teeth shown like fire, as he ran toward the
two cats, on the other side of the bridge. Then Catty and Meowmeow ran to him. They started to
fight him, but he fought back. Suddenly, the evil cat revealed the secret truth about himself.
He told Catty and Meowmeow that he was Catty’s evil clone from the future. He was sent to the
past to destroy his master’s greatest enemy, the Karate Cats. His real name was Evil Catty.
Then Meowmeow kicked Evil Catty, and he stumbled. Catty kicked Evil Catty too, and Evil Catty 
fell like a rock. While he was falling, Evil Catty screamed, “I will have my revenge for this!”
Then Tom, who watched the whole battle, hugged his sons and exclaimed, “Well done Karate Cats!”
